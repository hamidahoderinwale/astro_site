    I’m not really too sure what to put here, but I’ll take a swing :)
<br>
<br>
    I’m a rising first year at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/" target="_blank">McGill</a> I'm taking courses in Econ, CS and Math. 
<br>
<br>  
    I’m a summer fellow at the <a href="https://progress.institute/" target="_blank">Institute for Progress</a>.

    The closest I can get to a unified theory of purpose is touching grass (let this be as deep as you want it to be).

 <br>  
    Recently, I joined the <a href="https://joininteract.com/" target="_blank">Interact</a> community and I’m super excited to see what that’s about.
<br> 
<br> 
    I like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/oderinwaleh?si=f9071f63689c40f4" target="_blank"> listening to music</a>, coffee, <a href="https://curius.app/hamidah-oderinwale" target="_blank">being chronically online </a>(the coffee helps with that), and film.
