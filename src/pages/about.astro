    Hi, I'm Hamidah! 
<br>
<br>
    Iâ€™m a student at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/" target="_blank">McGill</a> and a (summer) fellow at the <a href="https://progress.institute/" target="_blank">Institute for Progress</a>. Some things I find interesting include: developing "accurate" semi-endogeneous growth models and how good ones can actually help us, figuring out what it means to live the good life and the other interesting things that aren't here ;) 
 <br>  
 <br> 
   I believe touching grass is a categorical imperative.

    Here's my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/oderinwaleh?si=f9071f63689c40f4" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, and what I'm <a href="https://curius.app/hamidah-oderinwale" target="_blank">reading on the internet.</a>
