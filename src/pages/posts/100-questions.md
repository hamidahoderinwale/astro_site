<h2> 100 Questions </h2>
<p><i>April 2023</i></p>

For the SPARC 23 application, one of the prompts asked applicants to generate a list of 100 questions that piqued their interest. I thought it was a cool question, so here we go.

1. Can a sense of responsibility be engrained in people without authority? Although, I have a better sense of obligation now, most of the things I feel like I have to do were once prescribed by teachers, parents, etc.
2. Would I ever be able to get to the same level of fluency and comfort with the English language if it wasn’t my first?
3. Why did it take me so long to come up with 100 questions? What does the amount of time this took say about me?
4. Would you consider humility to be a virtue, how do/would you act in accordance to your opinion on this?
5. Civilization has gone to its primitive state, post-catastrophe and you’re deemed the leader (can come up with a scenario where this makes sense, you have the most knowledge about a pre-catastrophic world, f.ex). In which ways do you attempt to govern?
6. You have 20 years to gain the most power on a global scale, what steps do you take? Some might say becoming the president of the US, I would be curious to see if anyone has more interesting ideas, like finding a way to commoditize water to the extent that by 2032, when droughts are more common, they have a significant amount of leverage, etc?
7. If wellbeing is relative, what’s the moral harm in bringing everyone down to a hunter-gatherers standard of living?
8. How could one design a really good ecology class? What if instead of teaching classroom norms (i.e. sharing) we had a rudimentary explanation of the Tragedy of the Commons, Free-riders, etc. How would this impact the adherence to the norms we wish to have in the first place.
9. What’s the % drop-off in culture generationally for those who immigrate to Western Countries? What would the quantified values be? (ethnic decisions able to made, language fluency, etc.)?
