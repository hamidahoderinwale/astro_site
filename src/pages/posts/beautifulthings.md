When Humans Can No Longer Excel, Let the Beautiful Prevail.
===========================================================

When Humans Can No Longer Excel, Let the Beautiful Prevail.
1

The Bible, Torah and the Qu’ran vividly describe heaven and hell. Those who read them are met with intense renditions of dystopia and utopia through the Abrahamic lens. These narratives attempt to describe the otherworldly.

To this day, disciples devote themselves to repentance and obedience in the hope of experiencing the so-called beauty of heaven, while guilt haunts those who fear their sins may lead them to hell. Theistic texts are powerful in persuading and guiding action, almost paternalistically. Leopold Aschenbrenner seems to have similar takes, describing religious texts as having “very low discount rates”[1]. In this context, "discount rates" refers to the idea that the level of relevance remains stable over time.

Ultimately, the Bible may have just as much relevance now as it did 1000 years ago, compared to trade agreements such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP), created from negotiations between the United States and the European Union to boost transatlantic trade and now considered obsolete by both governments. The grounds for policy are ever-changing, and the relevance of such texts diminishes over time[a][b].

Maybe we can look to this for hope (if it is warranted) that the humanities, art, and literature are valuable in a way that isn’t appreciated as much as they should be.

As a relatively humanities-oriented person, what do I do in the face of potential impending obsolescence? In a later post, I plan to explain why future obsolescence could be expected. But, I’m confident that the media needed for enterprise will become increasingly computer-generated. I haven’t written an email without Google’s smart compose and now ChatGPT since they’ve been released. It’s become embedded in how I communicate with people when I need to be professional.

I once strongly considered being a humanities major, but today it seems naive to, at the very least, not do something technical as a double major. This consensus seems to have been reached by many college students choosing not to take on a humanities major.

I try to be “useful” in the age of LLMs. LLMs that, in minutes, write an essay worthy of a higher grade than the one that took me hours. What do I do? Perhaps I should wallow in doom, rooted in the idea that in the future, my sense of purpose may not be attached to what I produce. Human creation is no longer unique. It’s no longer rare, and maybe we head into the future, where said output is now unoriginal, worse off than the computer-generated replacement. Then what?

Now, I recognize some self-awareness is necessary. I understand this makes me look really melodramatic. I resolved my own anxious anticipation of the future with “a nothing matters, carpe diem attitude”.

In a period of nihilism, I concluded I must turn to an appreciation of aesthetics. Is this what I ought to do instead of “real” work? We turn to aesthetic philosophy for answers. I concluded that nothing really matters: admire what is satisfactory and relish in the works of others instead of doing anything of your own — time to binge-listen to your quirky Spotify playlists for hours at a time! Eric Bellinger and Watzky to Lieberstraume and Rousseau.[3]

In nihilism, I grew fond of beauty. Welp, it does suck to realize my worth can’t be tied to my output. My theory of how I add value to the world is now invalid. Nothing matters? We turn to Ecclesiastes 1 of the Old Testament [4]to capture the angst of my past (and sometimes current) self:

The words of the Teacher, "son of David, king in Jerusalem:

"Meaningless! Meaningless!" says the Teacher. "Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless."

What do people gain from all their labors at which they toil under the sun?

Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever.

The sun rises and the sun sets, and hurries back to where it rises.

The wind blows to the south and turns to the north; round and round it goes, ever returning on its course.

All streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. To the place the streams come from, there they return again.

All things are wearisome, more than one can say. The eye never has enough of seeing, nor the ear its fill of hearing.

What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.

Is there anything of which one can say, "Look! This is something new"? It was here already, long ago; it was here before our time.

No one remembers the former generations, and even those yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow them.

I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.

I applied my mind to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under the heavens. What a heavy burden God has laid on mankind!

I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.

What is crooked cannot be straightened; what is lacking cannot be counted.

I said to myself, "Look, I have increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge."

Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind.

For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more grief.

Eclesiastes 1:1-18

Even in a potential age where our intellect and output are null at the mercy of systems that can do much better, I can truly appreciate this. Yet, this appreciation wasn’t always the case…

When I was younger, I could throw myself into reading a novel picked off the shelves of the school library, start an art project that I would let take hours of my time, and practice my three-note sequence on a random piano when given a chance. I got slightly older and swapped Dork Diaries for mythology, and cartoons for “film” and colouring books for realist pencil portraits. Then I got even old(er)[c][d][e][f][g]:  an “older” that would temporarily mark the end of serendipitous, self-led pursuits for the arts.  Not only did my initiative to create diminish, but I (inactively) also avoided anything resembling “fine art”: old literature, classical music, etc.

What was the point? Too many things to do; they’re just ancient pieces that “withstood” the test of time to satisfy pretentious people whose egos won’t let them admit that they’re boring. After a period of instrumental consumption of the “great works,” from Chopin for French class to Orwell for English class, I guess something changed.

Recently, I attended the Emergent Ventures unconference [5] (which was amazing, by the way!). In true unconference fashion, the organizer had nothing pre-planned, and it was up to the participants to initiate sessions.

Looking at the sticky-note-filled timetable marked by those who elected themselves to run something. I noticed that every other slot for a session had the letters "AI" included. Recent events make this very understandable. I am most definitely in a content bubble. Still, in the slew of B2B wrappers and memes about Chat-GPTs' NPC-like talking quality, it's hard not to notice that things are changing fast, and even the most traditional individuals (anti-progress lol) [6] are noticing.

Nonetheless, amidst the slew of highlighter-coloured paper marked with the letters "AI", there was an interesting session about the "Arts and Humanities in Progress". Considering my current context, it was fair to assume that the "progress" in question would be around AI and technological progress. Still, attending would allow me to hear the wordcels talk amongst themselves, like the English teachers who came before us intended! Perhaps attending would give me a glimpse into a potential future in which I question whether the existence of these admirable humanities-oriented folks may or may not be as important.

However, the discussion quickly descended into philosophical semantics, such as "what is a fact (lol)", and so on. On a meta-note, when we think about what these pursuits mean in the age of progress, I hope these conversations can be less self-incestuous. Denying all change seems naive, but recognizing that this change is not worth having existential crises over is fair.

Don’t get me wrong; there were many gems in the session. I wouldn’t be writing this without them! The biggest takeaway was that words could help us dream up reality before it exists and create what can be ideated.

The session framed the humanities as a tool to push forth science — framed innovation as a consequence of arts folk coming up with ideas. An example is the book “The Mars Project” by Von Braun, which allegedly inspired more work on the space race in the 1940s.[7]

I recall an interesting research paper demonstrating how showing 'Queen of Katwe' to Ugandan school girls decreased their chance of failing their math course from 32% to 18%. [8] The movie depicts the true story of Phiona Mutesi, a Ugandan secondary school girl from the slums who took up chess and performed so well that she went on to represent her country shortly after starting.

This is an insane example of the media doing pretty cool things, empowering people to improve, and providing an image of success that makes a potentially great future more tangible. On a more personal and light-hearted note, the temptation to become a surgeon after re-watching Lenox Hill[9] is all too strong (lol). Romanticization can be bad, but it's exciting and interesting.

Contextualizing real-world dystopia relies on narratives crafted artistically through film and words. Understanding suffering that extends beyond my relatively privileged life in the Western world is dependent on those who share vulnerable stories with grace. Conversely, my ability to envision a better future that extends beyond what the eye can see is also facilitated by the same medium. For example, I think back to how developing my vocabulary was special in its ability to help me articulate my feelings. There is something powerful about being able to express oneself with words like "disillusioned," "overburdened," or "anxious" instead of struggling to describe a general feeling of dread.
Part 3 (A Tangent)

Regarding inspiring technological innovation through speculation and the necessary skillsets to do so, I digress. When considering science and fiction, I recall reading Sir James Jeans' Physics and Philosophy and being really taken aback by the thoughtfulness of his writing. It felt like I was reading a novel instead of a textbook.

Friends who witnessed my awe were likely subjected to reading the opening pages.

Sir James Jeans - the physicist writing prose? I thought back to reading a bit of "Road to Reality" and indulged in a tangent on the strong correlation between being a physicist and writing insanely well.

I was trying to think more about this - an ability to deal with abstract concepts on the theoretical ends of the field and the objective in the quantitative methods used for the language of the discipline. It’s probably an internal thing, where the pursuit of understanding complexity and contextualizing the world's rules, in a very rudimentary sense, is the building of a narrative - an ability to articulate utopia.

If you look at this chart which charts the math and verbal scores on the GRE by academic discipline, you’ll see that physicists seem to do really well on both axes.

[10]

James Jeans embodies this polymathic ability, at least according to me. Just read this excerpt (tears). 

Science usually advances by a succession of small steps, through a fog in which even the most keen-sighted explorer can seldom see more than a few paces ahead. Occasionally the fog lifts, an eminence is gained, and a wider stretch of territory can be surveyed — sometimes with startling results. A whole science may then seem to undergo a kaleidoscopic rearrangement, fragments of knowledge sometimes being found to fit together in a hitherto unsuspected manner. Sometimes the shock of readjustment may spread to other sciences; sometimes it may divert the whole current of human thought.[11]

I was thinking more about this - and the physicists’ ability to deal with the theoretical through mathematical logic. The pursuit of understanding complexity and formalizing it on paper, in a very rudimentary sense, is the building of a narrative about the universe.  
Closing Thoughts

Whatever this is (a blog post?) came from ramblings housed on my phone’s notes app. [12] When I think about what this is, it’s me slowly coming up with something like a unified theory of appreciation for the humanities—a jump from where we started at the peak of appreciation for Ecclesiastes 1.

As I reflect on my deinstrumentalization [13] of knowledge and content, I feel concerned about the fast-paced nature of our world and the importance of slower, more thoughtful modes of thinking. I recognize that some individuals, like physicists, can do both and articulate the future (utopic or not) while leaving something behind for future generations.[14] Assuming progress is inspired by those who can imagine it. I look to the humanities to build narratives of what is possible.

In a potential post-scarcity world (damn, I’ve been ratified[15], sigh) into the end, I think what it looks like to think about what we leave behind for its inhabitants and cultural transmission. Balancing between fast and slow thinking builds a more sustainable and meaningful future. By valuing both modes of thinking and creating, we can ensure that morals, values, and culture endure over time, providing a foundation for future generations to build upon.
