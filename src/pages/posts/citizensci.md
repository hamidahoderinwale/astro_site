<h2>Psychonauts, Biohackers and Distributed Scientific Progress</h2>
<h3>Harnessing the Benefits of Self-Experimentation and Citizen Science</h3>
<p><i>August 9, 2023</i></p>

In 1938, Swiss chemist Dr. Albert Hofmann discovered [Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide) while working at [Sandoz Laboratories](https://www.sandoz.com/) in Basel, Switzerland. Initially, he attempted to purify and synthesize active constituents from the ergot fungus that could safely stimulate the female respiratory and circulatory systems without harming the uterus. His synthesis was successful; he formulated a safe stimulant for women and inadvertently produced what we now recognize as psychedelics.

Hofmann did not recognize LSD's hallucinatory effects until five years later, in 1943, when he accidentally ingested his own formulation. The experience was so peculiar that he decided to try and repeat it. The second time he tried LSD was on a couch in his lab, a day that became known as [Bicycle Day](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/tripping-in-lsds-birthplace-a-story-for-e2809cbicycle-daye2809d/). On that day, he ingested 250 mg of LSD and had his first psychedelic trip, which was the world's first. The day got its name after his lab assistant was asked to take him home by bike. Hofmann documented the experience with self-written notes that became increasingly illegible as he fell further under the drug's influence. On Bicycle Day, Hofmann became the subject of his own experiment, a self-experiment, now a hallmark of psychedelic progress.

Being a well-accomplished chemist, Hofmann spoke to the revelatory effects of the drug he formulated, and his colleagues listened. He reached out to psychiatrist [Ronald A. Sandison](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-psychiatrist/article/dr-ronald-arthur-sandison/350EA7A27FA66EB827A66C22ACDB73E6) as a novel addition to Sandison's psychiatric practice. Sandison's use of LSD in psychotherapy at Powick Hospital in England received widespread recognition and admiration in the international community.

Ten years following Hofmann's discovery, R. Gordon Wasson travelled to Mexico to gather psilocybin. However, as the war on drugs intensified in the 1960s, President Nixon's Controlled Substances Act made [psilocybin, mescaline, LSD, and DMT](https://www.beckleyfoundation.org/psychedelic-research-timeline-2/) illegal, temporarily ending government-sanctioned psychedelic research. This marked a significant decrease in research, lasting for the next three decades. Despite how promising the field seemed to be, psychedelics grew stigmatized, and progress stalled.

This [figure](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UvLDsKvWtHPM0PyfClJXpPZER9BVLCOU#scrollTo=kikUGjRUVGAr&line=11&uniqifier=1) includes clinical trials in humans, behavioural studies in animals, commentaries, and review articles about psilocybin research. The results are drawn from a Pubmed keyword search for psilocybin". There is a steep dropoff in 2023 that still trumps psychedelic research output in 2010 due to the time of this article being written in January and February of 2023.

Years later, LSD fell into the hands of those without doctorate credentials, those whose labs were their home kitchens. Psychonauts unknowingly reignited the field by taking LSD into their own hands.

In addition to medicinal advances, the field of psychedelics provides a case study for decentralized scientific progress, spanning from universities to self-experimenters in their home garages. It is an example of how individual agency can drive scientific progress.

### Citizen Science and Trial Design

Looking at how the psychonauts have spearheaded experimental design under the constraints of a lack of institutional adoption. We can look to the practice of [self-blinding citizen science.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33648632/)

Citizen science has been at the forefront of experimental design due to the limitations of institutional adoption, and one such practice that has emerged is self-blinding. This method is fascinating as it highlights the level of trust between experiment facilitators, participants, and the wider community, all of whom depend on credible findings to advance the field. Self-blinding in citizen science is a research method in which participants randomly assign themselves to different groups, such as treatment or control, and conduct measurements or assessments without knowing which group they belong to. This approach reduces the potential for bias or expectation effects in the results.

![](RackMultipart20230810-1-jen8e8_html_ffb20a15f324f143.png)

###### **Overview of the self-blinding setup.**

"_First, capsules are prepared: microdoses are put into opaque gel capsules, while empty capsules are used as placebos. Next, weekly sets of capsules are assembled according to the dose schedule ( __**A**__ ; no capsules taken on Wed., Sat., and Sun.)._

_Then, capsules are placed inside zip bags with a printed day label (Monday, Tuesday, etc.; zip bags and day labels not shown on figure). Next, each weekly set and a unique QR code are placed inside envelopes. Eight such weekly envelopes are prepared, four of which correspond to microdose weeks (MD) and four that corresponds to placebo weeks (PL)._

_The eight envelopes are used in a semi-random drawing process (orange arrow,_ _ **B** __), which involves another set of QR codes and random number generation, see_[_Appendix 1â€”figure 1_](https://elifesciences.org/articles/62878/figures#app1fig1) _for details. The drawing selects four envelopes, corresponding to the 4 weeks of the dose period, while the remaining four are discarded (green arrow). The drawing is constrained such that only the three combinations of PL/MD weeks are possible, as shown in_ _ **C**__, each with a probability of 1/3._

_Panel_ _ **D** _ _shows the content of each envelope. Participants open the corresponding envelope each week and take the matching capsule every day. Scanning the QR links to the study's IT system and enables to decode which capsule was taken when."_

In the context of psychedelic research, self-blinding citizen science would refer to a study where individuals take part in a research study and assess the effects of a psychedelic substance on their own without knowing which substance they have taken. This can help to reduce the placebo effect, which can significantly impact the results of a study. By removing the expectation of a specific effect, self-blinding can lead to more objective and accurate results.

It is important to note that self-blinding is not the same as double-blind; in a double-blind study, neither the participants nor the researchers know which group a participant is in. In self-blinding, the participant is aware that they have taken a substance, but they don't know which one.

### Closing Thoughts

Institutions are pivotal in advancing science by providing funding, resources, and credibility for research. However, extremes of neglecting the value of practitioners or over-attributing academia are both suboptimal. Ultimately, it is essential that all studies, regardless of the researcher's affiliation, are conducted rigorously and impartially, with reliable results that can be replicated.

Recently, there has been a growing interest in the academic study of psychedelics. This surge in interest owes much to the work of psychonautic pioneers who have helped establish the safety and potential therapeutic benefits of these substances. Nevertheless, there is still a long way to go before integrating these findings into mainstream medicine and psychiatry. Nonetheless, the field of psychedelics represents a significant and ongoing effort actively reap the rewards of its humble origins.

Self-Experimentation

#### The Biohackers

Unlike psychedelics, gene therapy, presents much graver risks, with a significantly higher potential for harm, especially when self-administered by non-professionals. Nevertheless, some within the biohacker community take on these risks by self-experimenting with gene therapy to treat chronic diseases.

Many who suffer from chronic illnesses are desperate for medical intervention to improve their quality of life. They face costly medical bills, overburdened healthcare providers, and bureaucratic red tape that inhibits progress beyond the suboptimal status quo. Consequently, biohackers and those who feel forsaken seek to take control of their medical care. The toll of chronic illness can be enormous, and solutions outside of the clinical context can become alluring.

While the benefits of attempting to alter one's genetic makeup through biohacking may be significant, the consequences when things "go wrong" are even more substantial.

[Dr. Josiah Zayner](https://www.the-odin.com/about-us/) is a prominent biohacker who focuses on gene editing. He is a former NASA scientist prominently featured in the Netflix series ["Unnatural Selection"](https://g.co/kgs/Y1Jk6k) as an independent researcher. Zayner obtains his materials from online marketplaces, suppliers, and fellow scientists in the DIY biology community. Zayner is known for his controversial experiments, including attempts to genetically modify his own body and use CRISPR to modify the genes of bacteria and other organisms. Despite criticisms for his lack of caution and disregard for established safety protocols in his self-experiments, he remains an influential figure in the DIY biology community, continuously pushing the boundaries of what is possible in genetic engineering.

In February 2016, Zayner attempted a full-body microbiome transplant, which included a fecal transplant, to experiment with microbiome engineering and to treat gastrointestinal and other health issues. According to DNA sequencing performed on samples, the microbiome from the donor's feces was successfully transplanted in Zayner's gut.

Zayner launched a curriculum and marketplace under [The Open Discovery Institute](https://www.the-odin.com/bioe101/)(ODIN) that enables people to follow along and obtain the resources they require to self-experiment.

Zayner and other members of the biohacker community have faced criticism, but they offer a model of how high-quality information, transparency, and decentralization can be achieved.

#### Psychonauts

On the other hand, when examining psychedelics, it is difficult to overdose: harder for things to go wrong. The risk of negative outcomes is mainly associated with the experience during the "trip" rather than physical harm. It is the reason why this[woman who allegedly took 550 times the recommended dose of LSD](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/27/health/lsd-overdoses-case-studies-wellness/index.html)not only survived but had surprisingly positive outcomes. It is really hard to overdose on LSD, almost impossible, in fact. The margin of error with gene editing products and even other psychiatric interventions is much greater.

Still, it is hard not to look fondly at those who take their medical future into their own hands. It is up to regulators, institutions and the greater medical community to decide whether it is fair to leave all risk, responsibility and greater concern to those just looking for a way out from their suffering. There are ways to ensure individuals can enact medical agency with good practices while not promoting recklessness.

### Ideating the Informational Commons

There is a dilemma in which high-quality research, regardless of whether it is derived from self-experimentation or not, should be shared with all those who could benefit. However, if entrusted in the hands of the wrong people, the risks of harm potentially increase not only to the individual but also sometimes to society at large.

![Shape1](RackMultipart20230810-1-jen8e8_html_237499165a11f2b9.gif)

The [LessWrong (LW) platform](https://www.lesswrong.com/)and certain [Reddit communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/rarediseases/), such as r/Rare Diseases, flourish despite all the possible hazards, mitigating potential risks through self-selection and community norms. Though it remains uncertain whether the approach used exemplified communities can be replicated in other domains, particularly in the field of life science research and experimentation.

There is also a greater question of whether this is the model to strive for in the first place. Forums have cultivated norms over time, which may be difficult to replicate in a new context. Life science research and experimentation can have more serious consequences than many of the discussions on the LessWrong forum, so that it may require different safety protocols and oversight. It is also important to note that the rationalist community governs the LW community, and self-selection and self-identifiers incentivize abiding by these norms. Although the jury is still out on whether LW users actually embody this, it is harder to track whether the same conventions will be upheld when the ultimate aims may look different, the population has broader demographics, and people may be more emotionally motivated to have certain conclusions be true. Although the content on the LW forum is diverse, there is a history of independent research and de-facto self-diagnosis being carried out in a surprisingly rigorous fashion.

Public forums where scientific rigour is appreciated and enacted, slightly bending traditional practices to maximize possibility, and encouraging respectful debate may lead to a good future for scientific self-experimentation: especially when more traditional scientific institutions recognize the research circumstances and can use these platforms to inform their work.

LW is niche, but ultimately a more public and open platform than, say, the average medical journal. More discrete forums with less pretty UI and jankier approaches have existed for years, but with secrecy may come less criminalization. However, individual safety can be at risk when information about learned practices is less symmetric and distributed information makes the barrier for introductory information harder to obtain.

Open-source science and self-experimentation have the potential to greatly benefit scientific advancement and understanding, but they also pose risks, such as information hazards. The LessWrong community has developed a unique approach of using self-selection and community norms to mitigate these risks. However, whether this approach can be replicated in other domains, particularly life science research and experimentation is uncertain. Nonetheless, LW is a niche, but ultimately more public and open platform, which is a good model for the future of scientific self-experimentation as long as it is recognized by more traditional scientific institutions and safety protocols are in place.

### The Informational Commons in Psychonautic Research

In the context of the informational commons, the[tragedy of the commons](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/TragedyoftheCommons.html)can occur if the information is not properly managed and protected. For example, if people are not incentivized to contribute accurate information or prevent the spread of misinformation, the quality of the information in the commons can degrade over time.

In the case of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/), the website is run by volunteers, and the information is open to contributions from anyone interested in the field. This approach can help mitigate the tragedy of the commons by incentivizing people to contribute accurate information and prevent the spread of misinformation. And by providing a centralized and easily accessible source of information on psychonauts, PsychonautWiki can help to promote a better understanding of this field and ensure that accurate information is available to the public, which could be considered as Pareto optimal.

The practice of sharing one's process of independently navigating medical care is not new, especially in a field that is so vast and relatively new. Anecdotal advice and lived experience, when attempting to find the [SSRI that works for you,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luisa-rodriguez-837835bb) to experimenting with nootropics is the best source of information for those stuck between going to a general practitioner who may not give them the time of day and taking substances with no informational backing. This kind of system is reliant on trust. Although the mechanisms that sustain this trust are uncertain, it is important to recognize its current value and hopefully not only accept these systems but look to a future where this persists and flourishes.

#### Bringing people together

At traditional academic conferences, professors and graduate students often lead round tables. Panel discussions are attended and led by academic elites. In psychedelics, the largest conference is held by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies [(MAPS)](https://maps.org/). While still academic in nature, the diversity of backgrounds represented is greater than in traditional conferences, which often lack representation from practitioners who may not have formal education but still use the scientific method in their work. The Mind States VI conference, held by MAPS in San Francisco in May 2005, had the theme of Technology and Transcendence and featured discussions on the therapeutic effects of psychedelics, the use of mushrooms in ancient India, ongoing research on treating anxiety OCD, as well as art, high-tech, and the potential for psychedelics to be treated as mainstream medicine.

Conferences can be imagined to not only serve interdisciplinary collaboration but be a forum for the cross-qualified: breeding grounds for partnerships between practitioners and academics and individuals who convene on a passion for solving similar problems but enter the space with varying incentives and motivations and lived experience. The nuance driving breakthroughs is hard to deeply study, but can be acknowledged and cultivated.

### Looking to the Future

The field of psychedelic research has been rapidly advancing in recent years, buoyed by a growing number of independent researchers who have made significant contributions to our understanding of the therapeutic potential of psychedelics. As a result of this progress, psychedelics have gone from being viewed as taboo to one of the most promising areas being explored within psychiatry. Interdisciplinary research networkers like[MAPS](https://maps.org/) have played a crucial role in advancing the field by engaging contributors from diverse backgrounds.

This shift towards independent research exemplifies how breaking away from traditional bureaucratic structures can lead to scientific progress. However, it is important to address the risks associated with self-experimentation and to provide safer and anonymous ways for people to share their experiences. By doing so, the full potential of psychedelics as a tool for medical progress can be unlocked, and lives can be improved.

Psychedelics serve as a single case study, but self-experimentation has been utilized throughout history to advance scientific understanding across multiple fields, including biology, psychology, and genetics. Louis Pasteur self-inoculated himself with anthrax to prove his theory that diseases are caused by microorganisms, while Barry Marshall drank a broth containing the bacterium Helicobacter pylori to prove that it caused stomach ulcers. In psychology, Dr. Timothy Leary used LSD for self-exploration of consciousness, and Dr. James Fadiman continued this work with "The Self-Exploration Project."

However, self-experimentation has also faced criticism and controversy, particularly in the field of genetics. Dr. He Jiankui's self-experimentation with CRISPR gene editing caused controversy when he claimed to have edited the genes of two human embryos to prevent the transmission of HIV. Similarly, Dr. Aaron Traywick's self-administration of gene therapy for herpes sparked debates around self-experimentation ethics.

Despite these controversies, we see those who have celebrated self-experimentation as a valuable tool for scientific advancement. Seth Roberts was known as the "champion of self-experimentation" for his contributions to the field. Tyler Cowen called Roberts' theme of experimenting on the self the "highest stage of science." When conducted responsibly and ethically, self-experimentation can provide unique insights and advances our understanding of various scientific phenomena. Assuming progress is good, why should we inhibit it with stigma?
