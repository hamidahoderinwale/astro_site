<h2> [0] Musings: I cried listening to a song the other day </h2>
<p><i>May 8, 2023</i></p>

<em>Short journal-entry-esque writings have now found their way here. I'll probably preface them with '[ ] Musings...' to separate them from the rest of these things :)</em>

I’m regretting my words as I type them because this is peak oversharing at its finest. I was listening to one of my newest favourite songs, Autre Cote, by Elijah Fox, an exceptional contemporary pianist, and I was just basking in its beauty. One afternoon, as I was opening a Google Doc for yet another Politics assignment, I just started tearing up. Someone put time into this, put thought into it, and composed it. This is super overdramatic, but what better way to reconcile my true mushiness than to write this blog post?

I think there are many confounders here. I finally confirmed which university I’ll be attending next year. For once, I didn’t choose the least economically straining option while it was still affordable. Being independently responsible for post-secondary comes with stressors that have been hanging over my head since I clicked "accept". I just turned 18 and am now officially an adult, even though this actually changes very little beyond my ability to finally own a credit card and start contributing to my TFSA. But regardless, in retrospect, I’m pretty satisfied with my ability to just be carried away.

This summer, I suspect that the majority of my writing will have a professional, analytical flavour. I thought I would use ODP to write more research-type pieces that revolved around my most recent rabbit holes, but I think I’ll embrace this stream-of-consciousness-type writing style. I enjoy reading others, and I think as much as I’m a feely-humanities-oriented person, I need to get better at true authenticity and being able to articulate it well. Hopefully, some general factorization works itself out and I can figure out the essence of all these ramblings. Today, let’s discuss vulnerability, shall we?

Vulnerability is seemingly cringe-worthy. No one needs to know your bloody business. Vulnerability feels like weakness. Leaving all the possible ways you can be exploited for the world to see. Vulnerability seems shameless. You must present yourself in an appropriate manner, and you decided to overshare! Who gave you the right?

I generally agree with the sentiment that too much vulnerability, too fast, is probably bad. In a perfect world, mutual sharing builds trust, but this comes from being able to bond over shared experiences and the other person taking care of how you feel. Both of these conditions aren’t always satisfied; be cautious, I guess. But in times when I felt the most emotionally stunted, it was when I couldn’t even be honest with myself. I disguised deep discomfort with my future with anxieties about the menial things, self-branding as socially awkward when I was simply too scared to put myself out there.
