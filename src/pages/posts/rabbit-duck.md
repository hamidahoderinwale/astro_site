There's the popular illusion of Rabbit-Duck. An image of an animal that appears to be a Rabbit or a Duck depends on the viewer. A hallmark reference for anyone who wants to drive home the idea of perceptual relativity. 

Attempting to dig conceptually deeper, Wittgenstein - an Austrian philosopher - [argues that the illusion represents the distinction between perception and interpretation.](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0189753) When you understand that there are two potential ways to see the image: your response to what you think it is, goes from stating a fact to an opinion. It relates to our ability to understand our perceptual shortfalls, recognizing that we accept the illusion as reality even if objectivity is a virtue. We recognize the choice in stating our own reality while recognizing we keep this fictitious agency. Map and Territory. To be Straussian. The Invisible and Visible Curriculum. Phenomenal consciousness. We're all grappling with the fact that our senses don't tell the full story.

The book "Nudge" written by Thaler and Sunstein, delves into the cognitive biases that impact our judgement. If only we knew that hindsight bias is mere cope. Knowing about scope insensitivity means I can't internalize the differences between orders of magnitude - and as such, even when I make mistakes, my recognition of the fault saves me? We have cool words to label our mistakes: all reprehended if we can accurately label them afterwards. Reading [a New Yorker piece](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/frontal-cortex/why-smart-people-are-stupid). It was brought up that we're quite bad and notice the faults in ourselves but can notice them in others. You learn all this new jargon, and now you can go off on your friend who is making bad financial decisions at the grocery store. My rationalizations are my own, and yours is hidden. Virtue information symmetry.
